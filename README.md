## Taktse House Point Board

This repository contains code for Taktse International School's (www.taktseschool.org/) internal house points board. Database credentials are concealed.

This project was started under the guidance of Mr. Aditya Gupta, and is a first of kind software project being built by the following student contributors:

* Ingsa Subba <ingsa.subba@taktse.org>,
* Abhishek Subba <abhishek.subba@taktse.org>,
* Sonam Ugay <sonam.ugay@taktse.org>,
* Amit Agarwal <amit.agarwal@taktse.org>, and
* Bhibhuti Rai <bibhu.mahajan@taktse.org>

They are being mentored by:

* Aditya Gupta <aditya06031993@gmail.com>, and
* Dibyan Rai <Dibyan.rai@taktse.org>

The project is based on Python - Flask, and is hosted on app engine on 
http://taktse-houses.appspot.com/

We hope that this code is good for reuse in other academic institutions (however, code-credit as per MIT license would be appreciated), and for starting a software development culture at TIS.

Thanks!
